## My 1st Frontend Mentor Challenge :stars:

Hellooo :wave:

My name's nbdy1 and I'm a self-taught Web Developer currently aiming to practice skills to be a Fullstack React Developer :atom_symbol::technologist:. I suck at both frontend and backend :smile: and I aim to use [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) to help with one of those issues.

If you want to leave a feedback or suggestions on how I did the code, I'll very much appreciate your help and it will mean a lot to me for helping me to be a better dev :smiley_cat:.

**Thanks for reading, have a great day**
