My 1st Frontend Mentor Challenge

Hellooo

My name's nbdy1 and I'm a self-taught web developer currently aiming to practice skills to be a fullstack developer. I suck at both frontend and backend and I aim to use frontendmentor.io to help with one of those issues. If you want to leave a feedback or suggestions on how I did the code, I'll very much appreciate your help and it will mean a lot to me for helping me to be a better dev.

Thanks for reading, have a great day.
